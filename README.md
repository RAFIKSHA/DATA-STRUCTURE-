## **What is Data Structure?**  
A **Data Structure** is a specialized format for organizing, managing, and storing data efficiently. It enables effective data access, retrieval, and modification. The choice of data structure affects the **performance of algorithms** and plays a crucial role in problem-solving.

## **Types of Data Structures**  
Data structures are broadly classified into **Linear** and **Non-Linear** structures based on how data elements are organized.

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Linear Data Structures**  
In **linear data structures**, elements are arranged sequentially, one after another.

| **Type**       | **Key Features** |
|---------------|-----------------|
| **Array**     | Fixed-size sequential collection of elements stored in contiguous memory. |
| **Linked List** | Dynamic collection of nodes connected by pointers. Efficient insertions and deletions. |
| **Stack**     | Follows **LIFO (Last In, First Out)** principle. Used in undo operations, recursion. |
| **Queue**     | Follows **FIFO (First In, First Out)** principle. Used in scheduling tasks. |

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Non-Linear Data Structures**  
In **non-linear data structures**, elements are connected in a hierarchical or complex manner.

| **Type**      | **Key Features** |
|--------------|-----------------|
| **Tree**     | Hierarchical structure with nodes. Used in file systems, databases. |
| **Graph**    | Collection of **nodes (vertices)** and **edges (connections)**. Used in social networks, GPS. |
| **Hashing**  | Uses **key-value pairs** for efficient data retrieval. Example: Hash Tables, HashMaps. |

### **Conclusion**  
Choosing the right **data structure** depends on the problem you want to solve. Linear structures are useful for simple sequential storage, while non-linear structures handle complex relationships.
